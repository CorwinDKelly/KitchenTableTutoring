                    <h3>My Approach to Tutoring</h3>
                        I'm passionate about math and science and nothing brings me greater pleasure than sharing my passions! 
                        I believe everyone is capable of succeeding in their science and math journey with proper support.
                        My first priority is to understand what your goals and needs are and figure out how to help you achieve them. 
                        Beyond that it's my hope with all of my students that I can nurture and stimulate a sense of curiosity and
                        appreciation for the world of math, as well as a confidence and willingness to engage with math wherever they may encounter it in the future.

                                "Corwin has helped both of my kids immensely. He does a great job connecting with both my teen daughter and son with genuine curiosity in their interests. One of my kids really struggles to focus and stick with it. And yet I have been so impressed with how much Corwin gets her to do, in creative ways. My kids look forward to the fun math puzzle Corwin brings to the end of the lesson. One of the most special things Corwin brings is his genuine excitement for math that shines through as they talk about how math is applied in life. I feel so grateful to have Corwin as a tutor and mentor for my kids.
